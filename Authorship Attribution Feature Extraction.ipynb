    "              'Bozkurt et al. \\cite{Bozkurt} performed authorship attribution on Turkish newspaper articles using stylometric features, vocabulary diversity, bag of words and frequency of function words. For stylometric features, they used number of sentences and words in the article, the average number of words in a sentence and the whole article, the vocabulary size, frequencies of symbols used (periods, exclamation marks, etc.) and the number of incomplete sentences. They weighted their features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).',\n",
    "              'TF-IDF is a weighting system often used on words. It consists of two parts: term frequency (TF), which coulds how often a term occurs in a document, and inverse document frequency (IDF) which measures the term importance, as it compares how often the term occurs in a corpus\\cite{TFIDF}. The system is useful for measuring how important a term is for a document. For example, the word \"the\" will often occur in English texts, making it not important even though it occurs frequently in a document. TF-IDF has on many occasions been used in authorship attribution\\cite{Muttenhaler, basile:2019, rahgouy:2019} and can be used on different terms, such as characters, symbols or n-grams.',\n",

Contestants will solve various tasks concerning NLP and on multiple occasions, authorship attribution were part of the tasks. The methodologies used in these tasks are useful resources for feature and model selections.',\n",
    "              'In the overview paper of the authorship attribution task of PAN 2019\\cite{kestemont2019overview}, the 12 best performing models are compiled. All features involve character n-grams and other sorts of n-grams. Other popular choices of n-grams contain words, POS tags, punctuation and distortion. Most of the participants use TF-IDF weighting and SVMs as classifiers. Distortion is a method for masking topical contents of the text before feature extraction, focusing only on stylometric features.']"
