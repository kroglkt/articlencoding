# Article Encoding

This repository contains the source code for our master thesis project in which we focus on creating a general purpose encoding of Danish articles that can be used for different NLP tasks. We focus on three: Authorship attribution, newspaper attribution, and headline generation.
The data used is not publicly available.
We explore both fully manual, fully automatic, and a combined approach to ascert the pros and cons of each approach.


# Tasks

## Authorship attribution

Authorship attribution (AA) is a multiclass classification task of attributing an author to the input document, based on the training data. 

## Newspaper attribution

Newspaper attribution is, like AA, a multiclass classification problem. Here, the task is to attribute a source of an input document, based on the training data.

## Headline generation

Headline generation is a task within in the field of text summarization in which the goal is to generate a headline for an input text. Text summarization has two main categories: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization revolves around extracting key sentences from a text and concatenating them, creating a shorter form of the given text. Abstractive summarization, on the contrary, relies on a deeper understanding of the text through, e.g. semantic representation and linguistic features, whereafter the input is retold with fewer words. We focus on abstractive summarization in our project.
